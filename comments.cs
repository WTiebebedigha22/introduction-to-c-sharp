//C# Comments
//Comments can be used to explain C# code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.
/*
Single-line Comments
Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).

Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by C# (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:
*/
// This is a comment
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");  // This is a comment
/*
C# Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.
//Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by C#.
//This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:
//Example
/* The code below will print the words Hello World
to the screen, and it is amazing */
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
