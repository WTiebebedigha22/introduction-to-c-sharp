//To output values or print text in C#, you can use the WriteLine() method:
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
Console.WriteLine("I am Learning C#");
Console.WriteLine("It is Awesome!");
/*
Hello World!
I am Learning c#
It is awesome!
*/
//You can also output numbers, and perform mathematical calculations:
Console.WriteLine(3 + 3);
//The output: 6 
/*
The Write Method

There is also a Write() method, which is similar to WriteLine().
The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:
*/
Console.Write("Hello World! ");
Console.write("I will Print on the same line.");
//The output: "Hello World! I will print on the same line.
