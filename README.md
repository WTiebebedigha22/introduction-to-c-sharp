## 📖 Course Overview

This course covers the basics of C++ including:

- Syntax and structure
- Variables and data types
- Control statements (if, switch, loops)
- Functions and scope
- Arrays and strings
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, inheritance, etc.)
- File input/output
- Standard Template Library (STL)

The course includes hands-on exercises and mini-projects to reinforce each topic.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts (helpful but not required)
- A C++ compiler (like `g++`)
- A code editor or IDE (such as Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion)

---

## 🛠 Installation

To set up the environment:

### Windows

1. Install [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) or [TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/)
2. Add `g++` to your system PATH
3. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the C++ extension

### macOS

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Linux

```bash
